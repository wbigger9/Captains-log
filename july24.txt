Getting this Electron project to create an executable has been a disaster. The current error I'm facing
is 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on').' The internet has not been too helpful. 
There is also a persistent error with the date and time pickers.

We finally made some progress and now I get to work on a fun Python project.
