It's been awhile since I updated this. Over the past few days we spent some
time adding functionality to the app. We added a slider to umbrellas which
allows users to control the brightness on optional light fixtures at the
base. This involved adding the slider, making sure it called the database, 
and resizing the card appropriately. We needed to conditionally size device
tiles, making umbrella tiles larger than drapery tiles. 

Another project we are working on is making the app cross-compatible with
legacy zigbee devices. Zigbee devices utilize a bridge. Currently the app
is not cross-compatible as bridges do not appear on the device page. We need
both bridges and devices connected to the bridge to appear on the device
page.
