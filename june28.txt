I feel like a genius because I finally got the Current Admin App to run. 
After two days of dealing with compilation errors and another day and a half
of runtime errors, I am finally able to log in and see the home screen.
Solving the compilation errors involved getting needed dependencies and 
creating a couple missing files (config.js and preload.ts).
Solving the runtime error, "fs.existsSync is not a function", was more 
frustrating. I had to visit numerous Stack Overflow and Github threads.
Eventually I found that the solution was two lines of code.
In the webpack.renderer.config.ts file I needed to add
 "  target: 'electron-renderer'   // Target Electron renderer process
and in webpack.main.config.ts I needed to add
"  target: 'electron-main',  // Target Electron main process."
