Today I continued working on getting the Electron app running. I started a new project and migrated the old source code over.
So far I have managed to reduce the number of errors from over 1,200 to around 7. I first imported some needed packages and then
began addressing breaking changes. I am confident that I will be able to get this running soon.

The bug I'm running into now has to do with the lack of a config.json file. I'm not sure what to do because the project appears
to be looking for it outside of my project, in the root of my projects folder (for all projects). I fixed all the errors found
by intellisense, which is good. 

Also, a new one which appeared and is very strange indicates that the port is already in use. This is strange because I closed
the window (it displayed the terminal output).
I still believe I will be able to figure it out. I am learning about the debugging process, and it feels good to spend some time
away from the Flutter app.
