Today I took some time trying to get an older Typescript project to compile. 
The project is meant to take the bridge log files and download them to a
text file. It runs on Electron, and I have encountered multiple errors.

An unhandled rejection has occurred inside Forge:

Error:
 Expected plugin to either be a plugin instance or a { name, config }
 object but found
 ["@electron-forge/plugin-webpack",{"mainConfig":"./webpack.main.config.js",
"renderer":{"config":"./webpack.renderer.config.js","nodeIntegration":true,
"entryPoints":[{"html":"./src/index.html","js":"./src/renderer.ts","name"
:"main_window"}]}}]

I don't exactly know what this means but I am committed to figuring it out.
