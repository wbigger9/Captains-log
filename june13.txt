We succesfully completed most of the functionality of the app. The main thing
we had been working on was cross-compatibility. There was an older app
built using React Native, and we needed devices onboarded on the old app
to automatically appear in the new one. We were succesful and devices now
appear. 

Now I've moved to the server. I am currently trying to figure out how the app
talks to the server, as well as refresh and update my knowledge on serverside
programming in general.
