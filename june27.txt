I was able to get the Electron app running today. Now the problem is, when I
run it simply shows a blank white screen. The problem appears to be that the
main file is not mounted. At this point I'm not sure what to do. Before I was
able to follow the error messages, but now I don't have such an easy way to 
debug. I'm sure that with some more research and trial-and-error I will be 
able to fix it.

On an unrelated note, I also updated gcc. The senior programmer helped me do 
that. I was hoping that would fix the app, but no dice.
