Today I created a desktop icon for Android studio. I spent a good 45 minutes trying
to do it from the terminal before clicking a button on the app to make it.
I ended up with the Android studio folder on my Desktop and I'm unsure how
to get rid of it. 
I also updated some dependencies for the company's flutter app, which didn't
take too long.
