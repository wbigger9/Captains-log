Today I created a desktop icon for Android studio. I spent a good 45 minutes trying
to do it from the terminal before clicking a button on the app to make it.
I ended up with the Android studio folder on my Desktop and I'm unsure how
to get rid of it. 
I also updated some dependencies for the company's flutter app, which didn't
take too long.
The second half of the day I spent trying to migrate the legacy phone app to a new 
react project. So far it has not been successful. The app runs but it only
displays the splashpage which was autogenerated when we ran npx expo create.
None of the code from the old app is actually showing up.
