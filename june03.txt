Today I tried to fix an issue with the bridge. We discontinued service for
the old app so we need to integrate legacy devices with the new app.
There is an ongoing problem where devices connected to the bridge don't
appear in the devices page. We are unsure of how to fix it but I am sure
we will figure it out this wee as it seems like a relatively small bug.
